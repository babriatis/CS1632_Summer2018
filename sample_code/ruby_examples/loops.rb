# There are for loops, with nicer syntax than Java.
# Note that 1..10 is a special class of object called a Range.
# Also note that technically this for loop is actually a foreach, we are
# just "hiding" that by using a range - we will talk about that below.

# We can make this exclude the final value (acting like a standard Java
# loop by using three dots instead of two.

# All Ruby for loops are actually foreach loops - they enumerate over a
# set of values.  We simply used a range in the previous example to be
# the set of value to enumerate over.

# Note the following uses string interpolation.  String interpolation
# allows you to print variables as part of a larger string.

good_dogs = ["Domino", "Remy", "Mr. Barkerson"]

for dog in good_dogs do
  puts "#{dog} is a good dog!"
end

# That said, for loops tend to be not very Ruby-like.  Instead, we will
# often _enumerate_ on a list (such as an array) and do things to do it.
# This can be done by using .each and then a block of how we want to
# operate on the data

good_dogs.each { |dog| puts "#{dog} is a good dog!" }

good_dogs.each_with_index { |dog, n| puts "#{n}: #{dog} is a good dog!" }
