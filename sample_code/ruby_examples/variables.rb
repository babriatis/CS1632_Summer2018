# Variables act similar to variables in Java.
# In Ruby, though, all variables hold objects.  There are no "primitives" like
# int, char, etc.
# Variables are case-sensitive.  FOO, fOo, and foo are all different variables.
# Variables are generally snake_case (all lowercase, words separated by underscores)
# Use single-equals (=) for assignment, double-equals (==) for comparison

my_name = "Bill" # String
my_age = 38 # Integer
num_children = 1.0 # Float
likes_hoodies = true # TrueClass - Booleans are a little weird in Ruby!

# Ruby is dynamically typed - types are inferred at runtime
# Note there is nothing stopping us from doing the following:

my_age = 38

# This will print out (PUT String) the class of the my_age object
puts my_age.class # Will print out Integer

my_age = "Laboon"

# my_age used to store an Integer, but now it stores a String
# This is actually very dangerous and a common cause of issues in complex
# Ruby programs!  You send an Integer when it expects a Float, for instance.
puts my_age.class # Will now print out String

# Arithmetic operates generally as you expect from Java
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
puts a + 2 # prints 3
puts b - 2 # prints 0
puts a * b # prints 2
puts c / b # prints 1

# !!!- to force floating point division, make sure you have a Float
# This is similar to casting as a float in Java, e.g.
# int a = 1; int b = 2;
# float f = (float) a / b;
# In Ruby, can convert to Float with .to_f
# can convert to Integer with .to_i
puts c / b # prints out 1
puts c.to_f / b # prints 1.5
puts c % 2 # prints 1

# There are no ++ or -- operators - use "a += 1"
# a-- would result in a syntax error
a += 1
puts a # prints 2

# Any variable can also be nil, which is similar to Java's null
# I do not have a dog, so this reference is nil
my_dog = nil

# Unlike Java's null, though, nil is a true object which has its own methods!
puts nil.class # prints NilClass

# Convert to Float
puts my_dog.to_f # prints 0.0

# Arrays are just like any other object and have numerous helper methods

good_birds = ["Jazzy", "Tonic", "Ton-Dog", "Method"]
num_good_birds = good_birds.count # returns number of elements in array
puts "Number of good birds = #{num_good_birds}"

# Ranges are a set of values from one number to another
num_range = 1..10
puts num_range.count # prints 10

# You can convert a range to an array using .to_a
# This will be useful since you can do many more things with an array
# than a range, but we will discuss those later

num_range_arr = num_range.to_a

# Hashes (aka HashMaps, aka dictionaries, aka associative arrays) are used
# quite often in Ruby.  Hashes act like arrays, except instead of indexing
# by number,
# 0 -> "Dog"
# 1 -> "Cat"
# 2 -> "Bird"
# you can index them by anything, e.g.:
# Person -> Integer (age)
# Integer (id number) -> Cat
# Course -> Instructor

instructors = Hash::new
instructors["CS1632"] = "Laboon"
instructors["CS1530"] = "Chang"
instructors["CS1501"] = "Farnan"
puts "Who teaches CS1632?"
puts instructors["CS1632"]
puts "List of classes and instructors"
puts instructors

# Booleans are kind of odd.  TrueClass and FalseClass are two separate classes.
t = true
puts t.class # prints TrueClass
f = false
puts f.class # prints FalseClass

# This is fine, though, because Ruby does not check for boolean values directly
# It checks if something is _truthy_ or _falsy_
# true is truthy, and false is falsy, but there are all kinds of other things that
# Ruby can interpret as truthy or falsy!  Unlike Java, which will yell at you
# if you try to check the truthiness or falsiness of a value.
# In Ruby, generally EVERYTHING counts as true EXCEPT false and nil - even things like
# the empty string and 0, which in other language may be considered falsy.

# Note that we are introducing conditionals here (if statements) which operate
# very similar to Java.  See conditionals.rb for more details.
