# Define another method
# Add parameters like so:

def yay(name)
  # Interpolate string - performs .to_s on variable name and adds it in
  # the appropriate place in the string
  puts "#{name} is great!"
end

# Note that we can pass in any kind of variable
# Note that parentheses are optional unless needed for syntactical reasons
# e.g yay("Joe").class
# ^- This may seem like a hard concept and it's difficult to have hard and fast
# rules because Ruby does not have an explicit BNF definition
# But it will be easier to use in practice

yay("Bob")
yay(1)

# You can have an explicit return for early exit
# It is optional if it is the last statement in a function
# In other words, if the last line was "return false", it would do the
